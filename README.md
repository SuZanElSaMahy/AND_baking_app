#Baking App
It's about creating an Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
The app allows a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

There is a JSON file that contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients,
videos and images needed to complete this project. 

One of the skills demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in data.
